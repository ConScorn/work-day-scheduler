# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This app acts as a notepad, with areas to write and save tasks, organized by the hour. The current hour is colored red, future hours are colored green, and 
past hours are colored grey. Users can choose to save their notes to localStorage by using the blue save button for each box, and can overwrite them at any time.

## Usage
See the deployed site: https://conscorn.github.io/webdev-coding-quiz/
Clone the repository: https://github.com/ConScorn/webdev-coding-quiz
Click on any of the colored boxes to type in that space, then click the save button for that box to keep that note there. Thanks!
